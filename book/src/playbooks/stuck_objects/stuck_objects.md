# Help! My Instance/Subnet/VPC is stuck in a certain state

A common issue that is observed in sites managed by NCX Infra Controller
(NICo) is that objects do not move into the desired state - even after a user waits
for a long amount of time.

Examples of these problems are:
- Instances are not getting provisioned (are stuck in `Provisioning` state)
- Instances are not getting released (are stuck in `Terminating` state)
- Subnets (Network Segments) are not getting provisioned or released
- The Machine Discovery process stops in a certain state (e.g. `Host/WaitingForNetworkConfig`)

This runbook explains how operators can troubleshoot why an object doesn't
advance into the next state.

## Step 1: Is it a Cloud or Site problem?

The state of Forge objects is tracked and advanced in 2 different systems:
- The Forge cloud backend, which stores the states that are shown by the
  Forge Web UI and ngc console.
- The actual Forge site, which manages the lifecycle of each object inside the
  site.

If the state of an object doesn't advance, there might be multiple reasons for it:
1. The state of the object isn't advanced on the actual Forge site
2. The request to change the state of the object is not forwarded from the Forge
    cloud to the Forge site. Or the notification about the state changed was
    not forwarded from the Forge Site to the cloud.

A rule of thumb for locating the source of the problem is:
- If the states that are shown on the site and via the Cloud API are different,
  reason 1) will apply. This indicates a communication issue in the
  paths between Forge Cloud Backend, Forge Site Agent and Forge Site
  Controller.  
  <!-- TODO: Document steps to diagnose and remediate these issues -->
- If the states match, then the state on the site isn't advanced as required.

The next chapters will describe on how to lookup the state of an object on
the actual site and how to determine what prevents the object from moving
into the next state on the site.

### 1.1 Checking the state in the Forge Web UI or API

Another initial check on whether the problem is a Forge Cloud or Site problem
is to check whether the Cloud backend could actually send the state change
request (e.g. instance release request) to the Site.

The `statusHistory` field on the Forge Cloud API can be belpful for this assessment. E.g. the history for the following Subnet indicates that
the deletion request was sent to the site, but deletion might be stuck there:

```json
{
    "id": "1982d4fc-9127-4965-ae72-1c9675d5b440",
    "name": "b-net",
    "siteId": "c86caf07-9ee8-4140-9cd6-67325add393a",
    "controllerNetworkSegmentId": "b69ecd98-2a41-40f5-8e52-2ed0f82a38fe",
    "ipv4Prefix": "10.217.6.176",
    "ipv4BlockId": "e4b41f4b-38eb-4014-9397-ce8266a0cb78",
    "ipv4Gateway": "10.217.6.177",
    "prefixLength": 30,
    "routingType": "Public",
    "status": "Deleting",
    "statusHistory": [
        {
            "status": "Deleting",
            "message": "Deletion has been initiated on Site",
            "created": "2023-09-13T18:35:09.590055Z",
            "updated": "2023-09-13T18:35:09.590055Z"
        },
        {
            "status": "Deleting",
            "message": "Deletion request was sent to the Site",
            "created": "2023-09-13T18:35:09.248705Z",
            "updated": "2023-09-13T18:35:09.248705Z"
        },
        {
            "status": "Deleting",
            "message": "receive deletion request, pending processing",
            "created": "2023-09-13T18:35:09.05314Z",
            "updated": "2023-09-13T18:35:09.05314Z"
        },
        {
            "status": "Ready",
            "message": "Subnet is ready for use",
            "created": "2023-09-11T21:01:44.977235Z",
            "updated": "2023-09-11T21:01:44.977235Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, we can see the Forge Cloud Backend indicated it transferred
the deletion request to the Site. In this case, we should continue the
investigation by checking the site state for this subnet.

If you are using the Forge Web UI, not all API details like `statusHistory`
are displayed. However we can work around this by getting
access to the raw Forge Cloud API response.
A browsers developer tools can be used for this:
- While on the page that shows the status of the object (E.g. "Virtual
  Private Clouds"), open the browser developer tools. The F12 key will open
  it on a lot of browsers.
- Click the Network Tab
- Either wait for a request which fetches the state of the object of
  interest (e.g. `subnet` or `instance`). Or refresh the page in order
  to force a request.
- Click the `Response` tab.

You should now see the raw Forge Cloud API response, as shown in the following
screenshot:
![](../static/playbooks/stuck_objects/browser_devtools.png)


## Step 2: Determine the actual state an object is in

The Forge Web UI only shows a simplified state for Forge users, like
- Provisioning
- Ready
- Deleting

However Forge sites use much more fine grained states, like
`Assigned/BootingWithDiscoveryImage`. The `/` in this notion separates
the main state of an object from its substate(s). In this example, `Assigned`
is the main state of an object and `BootingWithDiscoveryImage` is the substate.

In order to understand why the state of an object doesn't advanced, we first
need to determine the full state. This can be done using multiple approaches:

### 2.1 Using carbide-admin-cli

You can inspect the detailed state of a objects on Forge sites using `carbide-admin-cli`. Refer to [forge-admin-cli](forge_admin_cli.md) instructions
on how to utilize it.

Using carbide-admin-cli, you can inspect the state of an object e.g. with the
following queries:

```
carbide-admin-cli managed-host show --all
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Hostname           | Machine IDs (H/D)                                           | State                              |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| oven-bakerloo      | fm100pskla0ihp0pn4tv7v1js2k2mo37sl0jjr8141okqg8pjpdpfihaa80 | Host/WaitingForDiscovery           |

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| west-massachusetts | fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0 | Assigned/BootingWithDiscoveryImage |
|                    | fm100ds7blqjsadm2uuh3qqbf1h7k8pmf47um6v9uckrg7l03po8mhqgvng |                                    |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
```

```
carbide-admin-cli managed-host show --host fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0
Hostname    : west-massachusetts
State       : Assigned/BootingWithDiscoveryImage
```

```
/opt/carbide/carbide-admin-cli -f json machine show --machine  fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0
{
  "id": "fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0",
  "state": "Assigned/BootingWithDiscoveryImage",
  "events": [
    {
      "id": 471,
      "machine_id": "fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0",
      "event": "{\"state\": \"assigned\", \"instance_state\": {\"state\": \"waitingfornetworkconfig\"}}",
      "version": "V24-T1693595082748421",
      "time": "2023-09-01T19:04:42.649738Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 473,
      "machine_id": "fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0",
      "event": "{\"state\": \"assigned\", \"instance_state\": {\"state\": \"ready\"}}",
      "version": "V25-T1693595158986448",
      "time": "2023-09-01T19:05:56.035999Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 475,
      "machine_id": "fm100htqrs9la1un8bfscefaciq568m2d23mvr75gjdevagedj7q4h3drr0",
      "event": "{\"state\": \"assigned\", \"instance_state\": {\"state\": \"bootingwithdiscoveryimage\"}}",
      "version": "V26-T1693603493579606",
      "time": "2023-09-01T21:24:52.554822Z"
    }
  ],
}
```

You can observe the detailed state of the ManagedHosts in the `state` field.
It is `Assigned/BootingWithDiscoveryImage` in this example. The `machine show`
command will also list the history of states - including timestamps when the
ManagedHost entered a certain state.

For NetworkSegments, you can use the `network-segment` subcommand:
```
/opt/carbide/carbide-admin-cli network-segment show --network 5e85002e-54fd-4183-8c4d-0346c3f3e94e
ID        : 5e85002e-54fd-4183-8c4d-0346c3f3e94e
DELETED   : Not Deleted
STATE     : Ready
```

### 2.2 Using the Forge dashboard

In order to get a first impression of whether an object might be stuck in a
state and why, you can use the [Forge Grafana Dashboard](https://ngcobservability-grafana.thanos.nvidiangn.net/d/WzX_VErVk/forge-site?orgId=1).

On the Dashboard, search for the graph which shows the amount of objects
in a certain state. E.g. for ManagedHosts/Instances, check "ManagedHost States".
The graph might look like:
![](../static/playbooks/stuck_objects/managedhost_states.png)

In this diagram we can observe ManagedHosts in various transient states
(like `assigned bootingwithdiscoverimage` or `dpunotready waitingfornetworkconfig`)
for multiple hours. Thereby we can assume those objects are stuck in this
state, and that operator invention is required to make them advance state.

The dashboard will not tell us which ManagedHost is exactly stuck. But if only one
ManagedHost is in a stuck state, we can deduct that this might be the ManagedHost a
Forge user is concerned about.

For other objects whose lifecycle is controlled by Forge - e.g. Subnets,
Network Segments or Infiniband Partitions - a similar diagram will exist.

Another diagram you can look at is the "Time in state" chart that exists
for each object type. It shows the average time objects have stayed in a
particular state. Any metrics on this graph that indicate that there exist
objects in transient states for more than 30-60 Minutes indicate that those
objects are stuck. In the following example for ManagedHosts we can observe that
the average time ManagedHosts had been in the `assigned bootingwithdiscoveryimage`
state is 1.65 weeks. This equals to 1 ManagedHost being stuck in the state for
this long, or that there exist multiple ManagedHosts in the state and one is stuck
for even longer.

![](../static/playbooks/stuck_objects/managedhosts_time_in_state.png)

## Step 3: Determine why an objects state does not advance on the Site

After we know the actual state of the object, we need to determine why
it doesn't advance into the next state.

### 3.1 What is required to move into the next state?

A good first step to assess why the state doesn't change is to determine what
would actually need to happen in order to perform a state transition.
The best documentation for these state changes is the actual state machine
source code, which codifies the conditions for moving out of each state. Use
the following links to look at the state machines for objects managed by
Forge:
- [ManagedHost State Machine](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvmetal/carbide/-/blob/trunk/api/src/state_controller/machine/handler.rs) (also used for the lifecycle of Forge instances)
- [NetworkSegment/Subnet State Machine](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvmetal/carbide/-/blob/trunk/api/src/state_controller/network_segment/handler.rs)
- [Infiniband Partition State Machine](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvmetal/carbide/-/blob/trunk/api/src/state_controller/ib_partition/handler.rs)

When looking at these files, consider that the software version deployed
on the Forge site you are investiating might not match the latest `trunk`
version of those state machines. You might then want to look at the version
of the file which matches the version (git commit hash) of the actual site.

The `handle_object_state` function in these files will be called for each
object whose lifecycle is controlled by Forge in periodic intervals. The
default period is 30s - but it could be changed in future Forge updates.

This means that if the state of an object could not be advanced within one
iteration of this function, it will automatically be retried 30s later.

Inside the `handle_object_state` function, you will find a branch that
indicates what needs to happen in order to move the object into the next state.

E.g. for the `Assigned/BootingWithDiscoveryImage` state that was detected
above, we can find the following logic:
```rs
if let ManagedHostState::Assigned { instance_state } = &state.managed_state {
    match instance_state {
        InstanceState::BootingWithDiscoveryImage => {
            if !rebooted(
                state.dpu_snapshot.current.version,
                state.host_snapshot.last_reboot_time,
            )
            .await?
            {
                return Ok(());
            }

            *controller_state.modify() = ManagedHostState::Assigned {
                instance_state: InstanceState::SwitchToAdminNetwork,
            };
        }
    }
}
```

This snippet of code describes that the condition for moving out of the state
is that we detected that the Host had been rebooted. It also describes that once
the reboot is detected, we will move on into the `Assigned/SwitchToAdminNetwork`
state.

Inspecting the [`rebooted`](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvmetal/carbide/-/blob/38849aed602a2ab6e19a5315b342db3d4535b143/api/src/state_controller/machine/handler.rs#L494-504)
function further will tell us that checks that the `last_reboot_time` timestamp
is more recent than the time when we entered the state. And checking even
further for where the `last_reboot_time` is updated, [we would learn that
it happens when `forge-scout` is started and asks the the `carbide-api` server
via the `ForgeAgentControl` API call for instructions](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvmetal/carbide/-/blob/38849aed602a2ab6e19a5315b342db3d4535b143/api/src/api.rs#L2771-2772.)

Therefore we can determine that possibles sources of the ManagedHost being stuck are:
- The Host is never rebooted
- The Host is rebooted, but does not boot into the discovery image
- The Host is rebooted and boots into the dsicovery image, but `forge-scout` is
  not running or might not be able to reach the API server.

We can now continue troubleshooting by inspecting which of these steps might have
failed.

### 3.2 Learning more about failures from logs

Sometimes we can easily learn from carbide-api logs why the state transition for
a certain object failed. If a state machine tries to advance the state of an
object and any function within the state machine returns an error, the error
will be logged.

For example the following carbide-api logs show us that the state-machine tried to advance
the state of ManagedHost `fm100htbj4teuomt9p8095cg3nikudaqq69uih6t3gg61tpgkkmtncvjbgg`
from state `Assigned/WaitingForNetworkConfig`, but due to a vault issue we failed
to load the BMC credentials for the reboot request that is required to exit the state:

```

```

As seen from the example above, the field `error_types` can also provide
a quick overview on what errors have occurred in certain states and
prevented the state machine to advance the state of objects.

```
error_types="{\"assigned.waitingfornetworkconfig\":{\"redfish_client_creation_error\":1}}"
```
indicates that for ManagedHosts in state `Assigned/WaitingForNetworkConfig`, state handling
for 1 ManagedHost encountered a `redfish_client_creation_error`. The consequence of
this is that the reboot request for the Host could not be dispatched.
Such an error will show up every 30s. The state transition will happen once
the credentials can be loaded and the reboot request gets dispatched.

In order to avoid having to manually look at each log line, try to filter the
logs by `machine_id`, `segment_id` or `instance_id`. If you find any recent
log line about any action which affected the state of the object, search also
for the `span_id` in this log line. It will show all log messages that have
been emitted as part of the same RPC request or the same state handler iteration.

### 3.3 Learning more about failures from the Forge Grafana Dashboard

The [Forge Grafana Dashboard](https://ngcobservability-grafana.thanos.nvidiangn.net/d/WzX_VErVk/forge-site?orgId=1)
can also provide a quick overview of why state transitions have failed.
In case the state handler of a certain object returned an error, the error type
will also be shown in the diagram which summarizes the amount of objects in a
certain state for each Forge site.

E.g. for the following example, we can see state handling for 1 ManagedHost in state
`assigned waitingfornetworkconfig` failing due to a `redfish_client_creation_error`.
This is equivalent to the information that we found in logs.

![](../static/playbooks/stuck_objects/state_handling_error.png)

The benefit of the dashboard is that it allows for a very quick assessment on
what the root cause of a certain issue is. It also shows whether just 1 object
might be affected by a certain issue, or whether multiple objects are affected.
